## Plugins
The Examples folder contains scipts made by the SapphireSoft for SRPG Studio. It provides a nice example of how plugins are created.

When you add plugins here please give it a descriptive file name for ease of use.
Better if you place your script and a readme in a folder and the folder has the name of you plugin.
The readme should provide enough information for the user to use your plugin.
Provide comments as well in you script so it's easier to understand and update!
